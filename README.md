## Overview
This toolbox contains all software required to implement closed-loop amplitude-modulated non-invasive brain stimulation (CLAM-NIBS) and evaluate the resulting electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.


## Why non-invasive brain stimulation?
Although invasive brain stimulation can be effective in treating certain conditions, this approach involves substantial risks. The surgical procedure carries a risk of infection and bleeding in the brain. Additionally, the surgeries and equipment used for invasive brain stimulation are often expensive.

These issues can be addressed with non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, like transcranial magnetic stimulation. No surgery is required, and therefore, infection and bleeding are avoided. These methods are also often less expensive compared to implanted devices. Furthermore, these methods can be easily adjusted or discontinued.
