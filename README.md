## Overview
This toolbox contains all software required to implement closed-loop amplitude-modulated non-invasive brain stimulation (CLAM-NIBS) and evaluate the resulting electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.


## Why non-invasive brain stimulation?
Although invasive brain stimulation can be effective in treating certain conditions, this approach involves substantial risks. The surgical procedure carries a risk of infection and bleeding in the brain. Additionally, the surgeries and equipment used for invasive brain stimulation are often expensive.

These issues can be addressed with non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, like transcranial magnetic stimulation. No surgery is required, and therefore, infection and bleeding are avoided. These methods are also often less expensive compared to implanted devices. Furthermore, these methods can be easily adjusted or discontinued.

## Why closed-loop?
Closed-loop approaches can make non-invasive brain stimulation significantly more effective. Closed-loop approaches enable the synchronization of the stimulation with specific brain states. For instance, the phase of the stimulation can be dynamically adjusted to the brain state. In addition, closed-loop brain stimulation can also improve personalized targeting of specific brain states, making this approach more precise than traditional open-loop brain stimulation.
